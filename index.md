I am Ph.D. Candidate in the John Munro Godfrey, Sr. Department of Economics of Terry College of Business at University of Georgia.


My research interests are Economics of Education, Labor and Health Economics, and Applied Econometrics. The focus of my recent studies is to employ a novel methodology called bunching to estimate the effect of watching TV on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills. I have been studying the impacts of the More Doctors Program in Brazil on population health outcomes.
