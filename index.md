I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the John Munro Godfrey, Sr. Department of Economics in the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia.

My research interests are Labor Economics, Health Economics, Economics of Education, and Applied Econometrics. My job market paper estimates the causal effect of watching TV on children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. I am also studying the impacts of Brazil’s More Doctors Program on population health outcomes.
