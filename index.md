I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the John Munro Godfrey, Sr. Department of Economics in the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia.

My job market paper estimates the causal effect of watching TV on children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. I have also studied the impacts of Brazil’s More Doctors Program on population health outcomes.

My research interests are Labor Economics, Health Economics, Economics of Education, and Applied Econometrics. The focus of my recent studies is to employ a novel methodology called bunching to estimate the effect of watching TV on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills. I have been studying the impacts of changes in the More Doctors Program after the presidential election of 2018 in Brazil on population health outcomes.
