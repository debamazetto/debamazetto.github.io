## Work in Progress

* "The Effect of Video Games on Children’s Skills", with [Carolina Caetano](http://www.carolinacaetano.net/), [Gregorio Caetano](http://www.gregoriocaetano.net/), [Meghan Skira](https://sites.google.com/view/meghanskira), and Isabella Yerby
* * *Abstract: This paper studies the impact of video games on children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills using data from the PSID's Child Development Supplement. We use a bunching and control function approach which exploits the fact that many children are bunched at zero hours of gaming, and the skill variation among those children is informative about the effect of unobservables on skills. Preliminary analysis suggests a negative effect on non-cognitive skills with increased gaming hours.*

* "Assessing the Impact of Physicians on Health: The More Doctors Program and the Exit of Cuban Doctors in Brazil"
* * *Abstract: Initiated in 2013 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the program aimed to enhance healthcare accessibility for users of the Brazilian Unified Healthcare System (UHS) in regions facing physician shortages, particularly in small and remote municipalities. Initially, an agreement with the Cuban government brought over 8,000 doctors from Cuba to Brazil. However, after the 2018 national elections, the Cuban government terminated the contract, leading to the loss of most Cuban physicians, constituting half of the enrolled doctors. Using a DID approach, I examine the effect of such event on population health outcomes.*
